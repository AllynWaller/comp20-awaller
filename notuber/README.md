Implemented: Geolocation found, marker placed. Nearest car found, infowindow displayed. Polyline rendered. Cars sourced from my own Heroku server (cryptic-reaches-40397)

To-Do: 

Collaborators: No collaborators, but did consult Maps API documentation heavily, including: 

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geolocation
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/polyline-simple

Time Spent: 4 hrs + 2 hours for lab 12
